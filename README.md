# odin-recipes
First HTML project of mine! On this project I will use all of the HTML skills I have learned of until now, such as:
- Unordered and ordered lists
- Links to images and other html files
- Use of different tags to create paragraph, heading and other elements.

On this website you fill find the recipes of my favorite dishes, I hope you can get to try them following the steps on each of their web pages. Maybe you will like them as much as i do!
